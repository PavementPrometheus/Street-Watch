    % *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
    %
    %\usepackage{ifpdf}
    % Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
    % compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
    % usage:
    % \ifpdf
    %   % pdf code
    % \else
    %   % dvi code
    % \fi
    % The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
    % Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
    % \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
    % When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
    % have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    % *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
    %
    %\usepackage{cite}
    % cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
    % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
    % \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
    % result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
    % "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
    % cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
    % \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
    % noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
    % such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
    % cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
    % version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
    % The latest version can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
    % The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

    % in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
    % that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
    % not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
    % which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
    % well as large increases in file sizes.

    %
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    % A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
    % many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
    %
    % Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
    % thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
    %\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
    % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
    % does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
    % version and documentation can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath
    
    
    
    
    
    % *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
    %
    \usepackage{algorithmic}
    % algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
    % This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
    % You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
    % environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
    % floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
    % algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
    % algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
    % correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
    % algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
    % Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
    % algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:

    % *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
    %
    %\usepackage{array}
    % Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
    % the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
    % appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
    % generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
    % respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
    % advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
    % set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
    % latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array
    
    
    % IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
    % generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
    % quality.
    
    
    
    
    % *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
    %\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
    %  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
    %\else
    %  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
    %\fi
    % subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
    % for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
    % incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
    % subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
    % which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
    % in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
    % and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
    % subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
    % handling of captions.
    % Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
    % than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
    % and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
    % on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
    %
    % The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig
    
    
    
    
    % *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
    %
    %\usepackage{fixltx2e}
    % fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
    % Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
    % in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
    % LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
    % guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
    % single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
    % figure.
    % Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
    % corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
    % be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
    % needed.
    % The latest version and documentation can be found at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e
    
    
    %\usepackage{stfloats}
    % stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
    % the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
    % as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
    % LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
    %\fnbelowfloat
    % to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
    % LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
    % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
    % with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
    % version and documentation can be obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
    % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
    % \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
    % that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
    % to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
    % packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
    % such ways.
    % Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
    % Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
    % of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
    %
    % \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
    % The latest version can be found at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix
    
    
    
    
    %\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
    %  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
    % \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
    % \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
    %\fi
    % endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
    % Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
    % IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
    % submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
    % figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
    % the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
    % \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
    % spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
    % prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
    % in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
    % that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
    % the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
    % the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
    % IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
    % so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
    % captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
    % the subcaptions:
    % For subfig.sty:
    % \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
    % \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
    % However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
    % the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
    % description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
    % subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
    % avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
    % and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
    % The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
    % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
    %
    % The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
    % later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
    % page by themselves.
    
    
    
    
    % *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
    %
    %\usepackage{url}
    % url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
    % handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
    % systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

        The City of Portland is updating their data gathering system to better 
        integrate data and technology into the decisions made by the city. One 
        issue arises of privacy in data gathering. Our task is to provide data 
        on, and hopefully a solution to this issue. Mainly our concern is 
        manipulation of data so that the data can be stored and analyzed without
        drawing the ire of the population or violating privacy portions of the 
        cities social contract. One such solution may arise from using existing 
        tools MOT and YOLO to extract usable information from the data.
    \end{abstract}
    
    
    
    \section{Problem Description}

    Up until 2018, Portland has used trained individuals to stand on city corners 
    and gather data on bicyclists. The city found that this method was antiquated 
    and error prone, so they began looking into other means of gathering data. 
    The opportunity presented itself through the Smart City PDX program which is 
    meant to use data and technology to address inequities and provide services 
    to under-served communities. This lead to an interest in the efficiency of 
    bicycling and public transportation. The City of Portland partnered with 
    Intel and General Electric to bring a large array of sensors to the community 
    which would serve to gather data on pedestrian, motor vehicle, bicycle, and 
    public transportation trends. Its purpose was to analyze traffic patterns to 
    help planners evaluate where crosswalks and bike-lanes will be most useful as 
    well as work toward minimizing traffic injuries/fatalities and maximizing 
    public transit efficiency.

    Since this effort was made with the community in mind, special care was 
    needed for privacy concerns. Portland is adamant about their restrictions, 
    making sure that no images or personally identifying information is preserved. 
    This means that all data operation needs to be done on the device, and little 
    data is left after scraping what they can. This makes more in-depth analysis 
    of the data difficult and inhibits the usefulness of the tools they have at 
    their disposal. The issue here is balancing a multitude of factors, but can be 
    simplified into three key terms: Preservation of information (split into 
    personally identifying information, and metrics for determining key factors for 
    traffic), and processing power available.

    This means that a solution must balance all three key problems. A correct 
    solution must destroy identifying information in an irreparable way consummate 
    with general public opinion of privacy, but maintain enough information about 
    the scene that data processing can take place including, but not limited to, 
    training neural networks (a form of machine learning), and general statistical 
    analysis while keeping in mind that all of this processing must occur on the 
    device in question (which may not have much processing power.) Although a 
    balance needs to be struck between the two data issues, no solution failing 
    the privacy check would be admitted. Finally, information left must be 
    generalizable as to allow as many projects as possible to use the data without 
    making too many assumptions about future technology and directions that the 
    city’s projects may take.\\
    
    
    % An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
    % Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
    % For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
    % Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
    % is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
    % even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
    % of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
    % \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

    \section{Proposed Solution}
    There are two key questions to be answered when creating a solution. The 
    first is “How far can we mangle the video while still preserving the 
    important data?” This is key because the further we can alter the video 
    data, presumably the more likely the saving of that data will be considered 
    “OK” by the community. Google has implemented ideas in this area for their 
    Streetview software for Google Earth. Their software attempts to blur faces, 
    license plates and various other information. The issue there is that it 
    often over compensates, or misses information. This is a huge problem 
    because the cost for false positives is much greater than the cost for 
    false negatives in this project. Two key tools have been introduced to our 
    team in YOLO and MOT.

    You only look once (YOLO) is a machine learning tool that works in real 
    time to detect and classify objects. This tools is especially important 
    for a few reasons: It has a scaling system built in which can be used 
    to trade time of detection for accuracy, and it can tell us with 
    relative accuracy what objects are cars, bikes, people, etc. This is 
    key because video data must be interpreted in real time, meaning that 
    our computations will be extremely time sensitive making this sliding 
    scale very useful. The other point works very well with one of my 
    brainstormed solutions to the problem which I’ll address in a bit. 
    
    The other tool is Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) specifically MOT17. 
    This tool uses a neural network to track the movement of objects and 
    keep a tag for each object. This tool can allow us to perform mangling 
    on objects over a continuous time, as well as preserve data on movement 
    even after intense mangling. My first solution uses this tool 
    extensively and as a corner stone. Generally speaking, these tools use 
    Tensor Flow as a backend and interface; however, we are given the 
    liberty to work with other tools like pytorch.  Finally, any solution 
    will undergo some form of public opinion poll to determine perception.
    
    My first brainstormed solution attempts to meld these two technologies 
    together to completely destroy identifying information while preserving 
    a maximum of usable data. The basic premise of the solution is to use 
    the MOT to identify all cars, bikers, pedestrians, and other important 
    measures; shade them using an indexed color; attempt to give them a 
    description with YOLO; and finally throw away all other information. I 
    feel like this is a decent first idea since, on the surface, it 
    completely destroys all personally identifying information, leaves no 
    room for false negatives, and preserves a non-negligible amount of 
    information usable by data analytic techniques.  Currently I have no 
    benchmarks or idea of constraints for operating time or processing power, 
    so unfortunately I cannot take these into account at the moment. Although 
    this is an issue, I feel that this plan is extensible and reducible to 
    the point that it may be able to interface with these constraints. 
    
    \section{Performace Metrics}
    The primary purpose of the project is exploration, and as such there 
    isn’t a clear metric for completion at this time. I see this project as 
    viable, meaning that the possibility of a framework or working prototype 
    is large. At the very least we can compare possible solutions, collect 
    data on public opinion, and synthesize a metric for a working system for 
    future designers. A final result should, at the very least, contain well 
    conducted research data into the public perception of privacy, specifically 
    in the context it is presented in the problem outline. A working prototype 
    in this case will be a system that can perform real time obfuscation of 
    data, in a irreversible way, without destroying more than 50\% of usable 
    information on motion and object identification. Possible prototypes may 
    be shown to work on a Raspberry Pi, or similar micro-board.
